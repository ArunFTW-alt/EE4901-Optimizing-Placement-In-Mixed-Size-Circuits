# EE4901-Optimizing-Placement-In-Mixed-Size-Circuits

This is my Undergraduate Research Mini Project, which is based on Optimization of Placements in Mixed Size Circuits. Placement is one of the most critical steps in a physical design flow. Hence, the current methods focus on building up a pseudo energy/potential between the components to be placed, to attain the density-based constraints and wire length which will go into the objective to be minimized.
